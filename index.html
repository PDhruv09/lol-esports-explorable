        <h2>What is being visualized?</h2>
        <p>This project presents a set of interactive visualizations aimed at analyzing key aspects of League of Legends (LoL) esports matches. The dataset used is sourced from Oracle's Elixir, containing detailed game statistics from professional matches played in 2022.</p>

        <h2>Why is it being visualized?</h2>
        <p>The goal of these visualizations is to uncover strategic insights and patterns in LoL esports. By examining aspects such as champion picks, gold differential, game length, objective control, and win rate distribution, we can better understand the factors contributing to victory in competitive play.</p>

        <h2>How is it being visualized?</h2>
        <p>Each visualization uses D3.js to create interactive charts, allowing users to explore different dimensions of the dataset. Users can filter and adjust parameters to gain a deeper understanding of each aspect being analyzed. The navigation bar provides access to each visualization for a comprehensive exploration.</p>

        <h2>Explore the Visualizations:</h2>
        <p>In terms of the project I have created a page where you can look at different visualizations of League of Legends game match data.
            I have created a different html page for each different visualizations and their discriptions. Each visualizations are made with the same
            data but are different visulaizations. The topics of this visualizations can be accessed and looked at the navigation bar.
            The most challenging part of the project will be to upgrade the visulaizations so that they do not look standard. It will also be difficult
            to write and Explanations for each visualizations in a way they they can easliy understand the visualizations. Styleing the website will be
            challenging as I have a bit of a problem where when I am styleing I get crazy ideas and to apply thoes ideas in a way that it does not interfier
            with the visualizations. the last part of the and probabily the least challenging is to make sure when the problem comes I can solve them without
            any help.
