        <h2>Explore the Visualizations:</h2>
        <p>In terms of the project I have created a page where you can look at different visualizations of League of Legends game match data.
            I have created a different html page for each different visualizations and their discriptions. Each visualizations are made with the same
            data but are different visulaizations. The topics of this visualizations can be accessed and looked at the navigation bar.
            The most challenging part of the project will be to upgrade the visulaizations so that they do not look standard. It will also be difficult
            to write and Explanations for each visualizations in a way they they can easliy understand the visualizations. Styleing the website will be
            challenging as I have a bit of a problem where when I am styleing I get crazy ideas and to apply thoes ideas in a way that it does not interfier
            with the visualizations. the last part of the and probabily the least challenging is to make sure when the problem comes I can solve them without
            any help.
